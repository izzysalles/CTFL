1. **In a system designed to work out the taxes to be paid:**  
**An employee has £4000 of salary tax-free.**  
**The next £1500 is taxed at 10%.**  
**The next £28000 after that is taxed at 22%.**  
**Any further amount is taxed at 40%.**

**To the nearest whole pound, which of these groups of numbers fall into three DIFFERENT equivalence classes?**  
a) £4000; £5000; £5500  
b) £32001; £34000; £36500  
c) £28000; £28001; £32001
